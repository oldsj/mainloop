# Mainloop Devlog

Build-in-public updates chronicling the development of mainloop — an attention management system that treats your conversation as the main thread of consciousness.

## The Vision

Mainloop isn't "GitHub issues as a task queue for AI agents." That's the mechanic, not the meaning.

The deeper vision: **You are the main thread.** Your attention is the scarcest resource in the age of AI. Not compute, not code, not even ideas — human attention is the bottleneck. Mainloop is built to protect and optimize it.

Everything else — tasks, notifications, reviews, AI workers — flows into a unified inbox designed to help you manage attention effectively, not fragment it.

## Index

| Entry | Theme | Key Insight |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| [001 - The Attention Bottleneck](001-attention-bottleneck.md) | Why attention is the real constraint | You are the main thread of consciousness |
| [002 - Memory is the New Context](002-memory-context.md) | The Temporal Pyramid strategy | Conversations that last months, not minutes |
| [003 - Plan First, Code Second](003-plan-first.md) | Agent workflow philosophy | Humans at high-leverage decision points |
| [004 - Spawning Workers](004-spawning-workers.md) | The spawn_task architecture | Parallel AI workers extending your capacity |
| [005 - Meta Development](005-meta-development.md) | Self-amplifying development | Building the system with the system |

## Content Strategy

This devlog serves multiple purposes:

1. **Canonical source** — Long-form content lives here in the repo, ensuring durability and version control
2. **LinkedIn/Twitter fuel** — Each entry is adapted for social platforms (see `/content/social/`)
3. **Personal branding** — Documenting the journey of AI-native development
4. **Future SaaS groundwork** — Building community and thought leadership before product launch

## Posting Cadence

- **Devlog entries**: 1 per week (deep content)
- **LinkedIn posts**: 1-2 per week (adapted from devlog)
- **Twitter/X threads**: 2-3 per week (bite-sized + threads)

## Tone

- Personal but not confessional
- Technical but accessible to non-developers
- Confident but humble about limitations
- Forward-looking but grounded in current work
