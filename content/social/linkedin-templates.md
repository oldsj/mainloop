# LinkedIn Post Templates

Templates for LinkedIn posts linking to devlog entries. Each template is optimized for the LinkedIn algorithm (engagement, readability, hooks) while maintaining authentic voice.

---

## Template: Problem → Insight → Teaser

Best for: Introducing new concepts or challenges

```
[Opening hook - bold statement or contrarian take]

[2-3 short paragraphs with the core insight]

[Link to full devlog for those who want depth]

#buildinpublic #AI #developertools #productivity
```

---

## Template: Story → Lesson → CTA

Best for: Personal journey posts, learnings

```
[Start with a specific moment or realization]

[What I learned from it]

[Why it matters for others]

[Link or invitation to follow]

#buildinpublic #AI #developertools
```

---

## Template: Myth → Reality → Solution

Best for: Challenging conventional wisdom

```
The myth: [Common belief]

The reality: [What I've discovered]

The solution: [How I'm addressing it]

## Example Posts

### For 001 - The Attention Bottleneck

```
AI was supposed to 10x my productivity.

Instead, I found myself:
• Monitoring 5 AI workers
• Context-switching between reviews
• Drowning in AI-generated PRs

The bottleneck wasn't code. It was my attention.

That realization changed how I build software.

I'm creating mainloop — an attention management system where:
• One unified inbox surfaces only what matters
• AI workers run in the background
• You stay in flow, not in firefighting mode

You are the main thread. Everything else is an interrupt to manage.

### For 002 - Memory is the New Context

```
Every conversation with AI ends in amnesia.

You spend hours building context. Explain your architecture. Share your preferences. Watch Claude become genuinely helpful.

Then the context window fills. The conversation ends.

Tomorrow: back to zero.

I'm building persistent AI memory into mainloop.

The approach: Temporal Pyramid compression
• Last 24 hours: full detail
• Last 7 days: daily summaries
• Last 30 days: weekly summaries
• Older: monthly summaries

Fresh work stays detailed. Old context compresses but survives.

The result: conversations that last months, not minutes.

### For 003 - Plan First, Code Second

```
The fastest way to waste AI-generated code:

Let the AI start coding immediately.

I've learned this the hard way. Claude generates beautiful code that:
• Doesn't fit my architecture
• Uses patterns I've explicitly avoided
• Solves the wrong problem elegantly

The fix was embarrassingly simple: plan first.

Now my AI workers follow a strict workflow:
1. Plan in GitHub issue (thinking out loud)
2. Draft PR (implementing the plan)
3. Iterate until CI passes
4. Only then: human review

The plan is where most value is created. The code is just execution.

### For 005 - Meta Development

```
I'm using AI to build an AI coordination system.

It's turtles all the way down.

The recursive setup:
• Claude Code helps me build mainloop
• Mainloop coordinates Claude workers
• Those workers help build more of mainloop
• Each improvement makes the next faster

What I've learned:
• Context is everything (CLAUDE.md is multiplied across every interaction)
• Small tasks work, ambitious ones spin
• Verification is non-negotiable (CI loop, always)
• You are the main thread (embrace the bottleneck)

The future isn't humans vs. AI.
It's humans orchestrating AI.

And learning to orchestrate well is the skill that will matter most.

## Formatting Guidelines

### What Works on LinkedIn

- **Short paragraphs**: 1-2 sentences max
- **Whitespace**: Single lines between paragraphs
- **Lists**: Bullet points with minimal text
- **Hooks**: First line must stop the scroll
- **Specificity**: Numbers, concrete examples beat abstractions
- **Personal voice**: "I" not "we" or passive voice

### What to Avoid

- Long paragraphs
- Jargon without explanation
- Humblebrags
- Engagement bait ("Agree?")
- Emoji overload (1-2 max, if any)

### Optimal Length

- **Hook**: 1 line, under 100 characters
- **Body**: 3-5 short paragraphs
- **CTA**: 1 line
- **Total**: 800-1200 characters visible before "see more"

### Hashtags

Use 3-5 relevant hashtags at the end:
- `#buildinpublic` (always)
- `#AI` (always)
- `#developertools` (usually)
- Topic-specific: `#productivity`, `#attention`, `#saas`, etc.

## Posting Schedule

Optimal times for developer audience:
- **Tuesday-Thursday**: 8-10 AM local time
- **Avoid**: Weekends, Monday mornings, Friday afternoons

Post frequency: 1-2x per week maximum to avoid fatigue.
