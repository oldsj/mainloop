# LinkedIn Launch Post Draft

what a time to be alive

2 days ago this didn't exist.

now i have a single thread that follows all of my dev work throughout the day. one thread. keeps context of everything going on.

spawns worker agents that plan. asks me to review. waits for approval. implements. runs CI. fixes issues. asks me to review again. merges.

preview envs along the way.

i've been thinking about where my attention actually goes. what's the interface to my own work. how do i stay in flow without losing track.

this thread is the closest mapping to my own internal human thread. the one that holds context, delegates, checks back in.

a single place to manage my attention.

open sourcing soon.
